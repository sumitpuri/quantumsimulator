# Quantum Simulator

This [jupyter notebook]() implements the Quantum Simulator for below Quantum Gates.

Operator | Gate 
---|---
Pauli-X | X
Hadamard | H
Controlled Not | CNOT, CX

Known limitation:
  - CNOT Gate can be applied only on consecutive qubits where target qubit is greater than the control qubit.
